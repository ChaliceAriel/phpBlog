        <p class="aboutPage"><br>My coding adventure started when a friend invited me to join his tech startup as a User Experience Designer in the fall of 2014. My friend encouraged and supported my growth&#8212; teaching me about UX design, Agile development, project management and testing. His passion was so contagious that I caught the coding bug!</p> 
        <p class="aboutPage">In January of 2015&#8212; my senior year at MSU, where I earned my BA in Music Technology&#8212; I took a Computing for The Arts course where I learned to program Arduino microcontrollers. In the fall of that same year, I quit my job in retail in order to focus on learning to code full-time. For about 4 months I studied coding on my own, trying everything from C# to learning the Salesforce CRM through their Trailhead training site. As I began looking for an IT job, I learned through a potential employer that a coding boot camp had recently opened it's doors in my state. I enrolled in the upcoming cohort and spent 12 weeks learning to code for 40-60 hours a week.</p>
        <p class="aboutPage">Coding is fun, intellectually challenging, and personally rewarding. It requires creativity, problem-solving skills, and lots of patience. Since there is always something new to learn, coding is a great fit for me. I'm still new to this journey, but I learn more every day.</p>
